    "To start studying neural networks, it is necessary to understand and be able to apply the most basic concepts of recognition to your model. A good way to test and train your model is to use the CIFAR-10 database which is a set of $60,000$ images for $10$ different classes (planes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks) which are identified from $0$ to $9$ respectively. With that in mind, you will train your model on top of this base, making it possible to correctly recognize each element of these classes.\n",

    "Congratulations on finishing the MPL course!! Hopefully, you learned some valuable skills along the way and had fun doing it. Now it is time to put those skills to the test. In this assessment we have two problems:  First, you will train a new model capable of classifying the $10$ different classes all included in the database known as [_CIFAR-10_](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). You will need to get the model to a validation to pass the assessment, although we challenge you to do even better if you can. You will have to use the skills you learned in the previous exercises.  Second, you will solve [_Kaggle's Titanic_](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic) challenge. The task consists of processing the data, generating the model, and doing a Deploy. Let's get started! "

    "To start studying neural networks, it is necessary to understand and be able to apply the most basic concepts of recognition to your model. A good way to test and train your model is to use the CIFAR-10 database which consists of a set of $60,000$ images for $10$ different classes (planes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships and trucks) which are identified from $0$ to $9$ respectively. With that in mind, you will train your model on top of this base, making it possible to correctly recognize each element of these classes.\n",

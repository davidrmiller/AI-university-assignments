    "TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google that is widely used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications. It provides a comprehensive set of tools, libraries, and community support for building and deploying various types of machine learning models, such as deep learning, computer vision, and neural networks. Overall, TensorFlow is a versatile framework that covers a wide range of machine learning and AI applications. However, when creating a model, the training process becomes a bottleneck as it takes a lot of time, but as we will see throughout the module, TensorFlow allows us to speed up this processing.\n",

# AI university assignments and workshops utilizing Intel oneAPI <br/>

This repository contains the material corresponding to the webinar/Hands-on: _AI university assignments and workshops utilizing Intel oneAPI_ organized by HPC/CIMATEC. The objectives are:

By the end of the assignments and workshops, students become aware of the breadth of the Intel AI portfolio and practical experience of the benefits of using Intel AI software and hardware co-optimized solutions. By default, students consider Intel's AI portfolio for future academic and professional AI projects. The material available in \*.ipynb (Jupyter NoteBook) format. There are some notebooks in this repository divided by topics.

## Getting Started with Samples

The best oneAPI sample to start with depends on what you are trying to learn or types of problems you are trying to solve.

| If you want to learn about... | Start with...
|:---                           |:---
| The basics concepts of using Perceptron Neural Network using IntelÂ® Python  | Node, topology with augmented vectors, training algorithm, and Convergence theorem. Hands-on using Intel Python* and Scikit learn extensions
| The basics concepts of using Neural Network | Multilayer Perceptron network architecture The Backpropagation algorithm. Hands-on using Intel Python* and PyTorch*
| Search Algorithms    | Genetic Algorithms, Bayesian classification, Ant Colony Optimization algorithm Optimization exercises using Intel SigOpt 
| HPC, and  Simulations | Performance Metrics for validating the developed application

>**Note**: The README.md included with each sample provides build instructions for all supported operating system. For samples run in Jupyter Notebooks, you might need to install or configure additional frameworks or package managers if you do not already have them on your system.

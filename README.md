## About:

This repository contains the material corresponding to the webinar/Hands-on: _AI university assignments and workshops utilizing Intel Packages_ organized by HPC/CIMATEC. The objectives are:

By the end of the assignments and workshops, students become aware of the breadth of the Intel AI portfolio and practical experience of the benefits of using Intel AI software and hardware co-optimized solutions. By default, students consider Intel's AI portfolio for future academic and professional AI projects. The material available in \*.ipynb (Jupyter NoteBook) format. There are some notebooks in this repository divided by topics.

## Getting Started with Samples:

The best oneAPI sample to start with depends on what you are trying to learn or types of problems you are trying to solve.

| If you want to learn about... | Start with...
|:---                           |:---
| The basics concepts of using Perceptron Neural Network using IntelÂ® Python  | Node, topology with augmented vectors, training algorithm, and Convergence theorem. Hands-on using Intel Python and Scikit learn extensions.
| The basics concepts of using Neural Network | Multilayer Perceptron network architecture. The Backpropagation algorithm. Hands-on using Intel Python and PyTorch.
| Search Algorithms    | Genetic Algorithms, Bayesian classification, Ant Colony Optimization algorithm, exercises using Intel SigOpt.
| HPC, and  Simulations | Performance Metrics for validating the developed application.

>**Note**: The `README.md` included with each sample provides build instructions for all supported operating system. For samples run in Jupyter Notebooks, you might need to install or configure additional frameworks or package managers if you do not already have them on your system.

### Installing dependencies:

For installing dependencies more quickly, you can run the following command at terminal, inside the clonned repository:

    sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
    pip3 install -r ./dependencies/requirements.txt

The project dependencies are described in ```./dependencies/requirements.txt``` file within the repository. In summary, heres what you're gonna need in order to run the project:

- ```python3```
- ```jupyter```
- ```scikit-learn 1.2.2``` 
- ```torch 2.0.0```
- ```numpy 1.23.5```
- ```pandas 2.0.2```
- ```matplotlib 3.7.1```
- ```pydot 1.4.2```
- ```graphviz 0.20.1```
- ```keras 2.12.0```

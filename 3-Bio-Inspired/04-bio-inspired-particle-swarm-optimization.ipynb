    "For example, in optimizing parameters in machine learning models, finding the ideal combination of hyperparameters is necessary. It may involve testing various values for each parameter, resulting in an extensive search space.

Consequently, as the size of the problem increases, the time required to find the optimal solution grows significantly. Additionally, many of these problems are classified as NP-hard, which means that no known efficient algorithmic solution works for all cases.\n",

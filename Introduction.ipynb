    "Intelligent computational algorithms, often called artificial intelligence algorithms, are a broad class of algorithms designed to imitate human intelligence or perform tasks that usually require human intelligence. These algorithms learn from data, identify patterns, make decisions, and predict outcomes. Here are some of the main types:\n",

    "* **`Machine learning algorithms`:** These algorithms learn from data and make predictions or decisions based on the patterns they identify. Machine Learning algorithms can be categorized further into supervised learning (like linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks), unsupervised learning (like K-means, hierarchical clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA)), and reinforcement learning.\n",

These algorithms can learn complex patterns in large datasets. Examples include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image processing, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for sequence data, and Transformers for natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`Optimization algorithms`:** These algorithms are designed to find the best solution from all feasible solutions. Examples include gradient descent, genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, and simulated annealing.\n",

    "* **`Fuzzy logic systems`:** These algorithms mimic human reasoning by allowing for approximate values and inferences rather than exact values. They are instrumental in control systems and decision-making.\n",
